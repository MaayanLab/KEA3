				<h2> Overview </h2>
				<hr width="50%" class="my-2">
				<p> 



				KEA2 (Kinase Enrichment Analysis 2) is a tool which takes an input of a gene list and outputs a list of associated kinases. This tool was originally built in 2009, but many kinase-substrate databases that were originally curated have expanded and new kinase-substrate databases have emerged. Thus, the purpose of the KEA3 project is to collect and process new data pertaining to kinase-substrate interactions and expand the KEA2 database, ultimately allowubg for a more comprehensive understanding of the human kinome. Thus far, kinase-substrate interactions have been integrated from seven databases, and the data from each has been converted into GMT and SIG files, found in the "Kinase-Substrate Networks" tab. 

				GMT files are used to describe gene sets, as each row corresponds to a different gene set. Each row lists a name (for example, a kinase in kinase-substrate interactions), a description, and the genes in the gene set (in this example, all of the substrates that interact with the kinase).

				SIG files represent gene interaction networks, also according to a row. Each row must have the name of the gene, four empty fields, the gene with which it interacts, additional fields (optional), and finally the corresponding PubMed ID or citation of the original article if no PubMed ID is provided. 


				In addition to kinase-substrate interactions, this website will also host data related to protein-protein interactions and transcription factor-target interactions, found respectively in the "Protein Interaction Networks (PPI)" and "Transcription Factor-Target Interactions". This data has been similarly compiled from different PPI and TF-target databases, and the data was processed to form GMT files. PPI data is also represented in SIG file format.

				For all three interaction types, the processed files and information regarding processing can be found in the corresponding tabs. The Methods section also provides a brief explanation of the data processing.

				<h2> Methods </h2>
				<hr width="50%" class="my-2">
				<p> For the "Kinase-Substrate Networks", Python scripts were written for each kinase-substrate database to process the raw data in the GMT and SIG file formats. Jupyter Notebooks corresponding to these scripts can be found for each kinase-substrate database and include comments detailing the function of each code block for increased clarity. When processing the data, only kinases which had at least five substrates and no more than 2000 substrates are included in the GMT files below. However, the SIG files include all kinase-substrate interactions regardless of the number of substrates. Furthermore, data was also filtered by species, so the below data reflects only kinases found in humans and mice. For the "Protein Interaction Networks (PPI)", there are five Jupyter Notebooks (which each process all of the databases in a single notebook) detailing the methods used to process the data. The 'PPI-Human Data' notebook filters data related to PPI-Human Data protein-protein interactions for all of the PPI databases, and the 'PPI- Mouse Data' notebook filters data related to PPI-Mouse Data protein-protein interactions for all of the PPI databases. The 'PPI-Combined' notebook combines PPI-Human Data and PPI- Mouse Data data together for each PPI database, and the 'Create Sig File' notebook creates a SIG file for each database using the combined data. Finally, the 'SIG_to_GMT' notebook takes the SIG files and converts them to GMT files. For the GMT file, only proteins which had at least five interactions and no more than 2000 interactions were included in the GMT files.
